# Road Object Detection

This Road_Object_Detection.py file is AI software made to detect stop signs and pedestrians. As you can see on the image, not all pedestrians are detected, the cause for that can be a lot of things (lightning, time of the day, video quaility...), but I am trying to fix it :).
